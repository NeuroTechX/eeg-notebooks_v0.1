Visual Go-No-Go
=========================================================

An experiment designed to investigate the event-related potentials that can be detected during a Go-No-Go Task, which measures executive, inhibitory control and sustained attention. The subject is rapidly presented with a sequence of circles and squares and is asked to indicate, by pressing the spacebar, whether a shape is a circle.
