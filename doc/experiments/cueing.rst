Visual Cueing 
=========================================================

The visual cueing task can ellicit a number of reliable changes. A central cue indicates the location of an upcoming target onset. Here the task can be changed to be perfectly predictive, or have some level of cue validity. The task is to indicate the orientation of a spatial grating on the target, up for vertical, right for horizontal.

The examples below demonstrate the following neural and cognitive empirical phenomena, elicited by the visual cueing task:

*ERPs* - Validly cued targets ellict larger ERPs than invalidly cued targets

*Response ERPs* - Validly cued targets are more quickly identified and better identified

*Oscillations* - Alpha power lateralizes after a spatial cue onset preceeding the upcoming onset of a target. Alpha power becomes smaller contraleral to the target side, and larger ipsilateral with the target.
