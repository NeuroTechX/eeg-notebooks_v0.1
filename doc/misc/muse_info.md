# Technical Information about the MUSE

## MUSE setup and usage 

There is a lot of excellent information on MUSE setup and usage on the [website of the Krigolson lab website](http://www.krigolsonlab.com/muse-help.html) at the University of Victoria, BC. 

The following instructional videos are particularly worth checking out:


### Introduction to the MUSE

## Details related to Muse ERP analysis


Latency and jitter related from the Muse is 40ms +-20ms

In Krigolson lab's resampling analysis, a sample size of 10 was found to be needed for high
statistical accuracy for N200 and reward positivity, which is similar to traditional EEG,
but greater numbers of subjects were needed for P300
