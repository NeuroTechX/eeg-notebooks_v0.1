    "You can use this notebook to run N170, P300, or SSVEP experiments (these are the experiments that currently have a corresponding PC notebook, as you can see in the `~/eeg-notebooks/notebooks` directory. Here is a brief description of each of the experiments:\n",

    "* <b> N170 </b>: The N170 was first described by Shlomo Bentin and colleagues in 1996,[5] who measured ERPs from participants viewing faces and other objects. They found that human faces and face parts (such as eyes) elicited different responses than other stimuli, including animal faces, body parts, and cars.\n",
